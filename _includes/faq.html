          <p>What's this ECS100/UI thing you keep talking about?</p>
          <p>
            The ECS100 Jar is the ONLY external library permitted by BluJm rules. It is the library given to 100-level students at Victoria University of Wellington Engineering and Computer Science students and is the backbone of this competition.
          </p>

          <p>Why can't I use X langauge instead of Java?</p>
          <p>
            Because for this event we want to focus on junior developers while giving a fun twist. Look out for Pxljm.
          </p>

          <p>Why can't I use X library/jar/engine? (even though it's open source...)</p>
          <p>
            We have a hard rule on submissions not having any external dependencies of any kind. We discourage the use of code not written by your team members as it detracts from the original meaning of the game jam. You can however copy/combine/change your existing code to fit your project, meaning you could create an engine for your team before the competition (in fact, we encourage this). Look out for pxljm.

          <p>I didn't/can't sign up, can I still come?</p>
          <p>
            Hmmmm.... no.
          </p>

          <p>Do you supply and Food/Water?</p>
          <p>
            Pizza? Water is freely available at one of the drinking fountains or in one of the bathrooms.
          </p>

          <p>What do I need to bring?</p>
          <p>
            The only thing you are "required" to bring is your entry fee and a computer. Everything else, including food, spare clothes, deoderant, is optional but highly recommended. Please bring headphones if you need sound, there will be ALOT of other people who do not want/need to listen to your bad music or repetitive gameplay testing (Looking at you TAFT).

          <p>Do you have a spare computer for me to use?</p>
          <p>
            No. See "What do I need to bring?".</p>

          <p>Will we have internet?</p>
          <p>
            Yes, there is gurenteed internet over Guest WiFi at VUW. We also setup fast wired internet and WiFi permitting we don't run into techinical troubles.
          </p>

          <p>Is there parking avaliable?</p>
          <p>
            Yes, there is free parking avaliable all weekend, see our desription on where to park. Offically it is avaliable from 7pm Friday until 5am Monday, but if you're lucky you could park there earlier on Friday night. We take no responsibility if you get ticketed before 7pm on the Friday though.
          </p>

          <p>Can I go home?</p>
          <p>
            Yes, you can leave and come back anytime, as many times as you want. In the spirit of Game Jams we encourage everyone to spend their time programming at the event, but we also want people to look after themselves, which often includes getting a good night sleep in their own bed instead of on the floor. After hours you will need a key card to access to the building, but you can contact one of the event orginisers if you get locked out at any point.

          <p>Why the name BluJm?</p>
          <p>
            Why the name BluJm?
            It started when we were looking to create another game jam alongside PxlJm. We were focused on encouraging and nurturing newer people while still having the more experienced game makers join in. We decided that by introducing a rule that reduced the tools to those the newer people are familiar with or are easier to grasp they would feel more comfortable creating a game with them. The name BluJm comes from the BlueJ IDE that new ECS students use at VUW use when they learn to program in Java.
