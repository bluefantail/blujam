  <p>What are these ECS100 and UI thing you keep talking about?</p>
  <p>The ECS100 library is the only library (aside from the Java standard library) permitted by BluJm rules. It is the library given to 100-level Engineering and Computer Science students at Victoria University of Wellington when they start learning Java and forms the backbone of this competition.</p>

  <p>Why can't I use X language instead of Java</p>
  <p>We want this event to be accessible on junior developers while giving a fun twist for veterans. Everyone starts out on a more even footing and can learn a lot from people around them from game ideas all the way down to their code. If you're interested in a more standard game jam look out for <a href="http://pxljm.com/">PxlJm</a>.</p>

  <p>Why can't I use X library/jar/engine?</p>
  <p>We have a hard rule on submissions not using any external libraries. We discourage the use of code not written by your team members as it detracts from the original meaning of the game jam. You can however copy/combine/change your existing code to fit your project, meaning you could create an engine for your team before the competition (in fact, we encourage this). Look out for PxlJm.</p>

  <p>I didn't sign up, can I still come?</p>
  <p>We can not accept anyone who has not signed up before the competition begins or if we have already reached maximum capacity. If you are having difficulty registering while sign ups are open please contact us and we will try to help you out.</p>

  <p>How/when do I pay?</p>
  <p>Cash (correct change appreciated) at the start of the event. We don't do pre-payment because its easier to have people who turn up pay than deal with refunds for those who don't. We do not accept EFTPOS. A team must have all of their members pay in order to be fully registered for submission/prizes but members may drop from the team if they don't turn up.</p>

  <p>How many people can I have in my team?</p>
  <p>We impose a maximum of 5 for your own good; larger teams are harder to coordinate. This also keeps the teams on a roughly level playing field in terms of manpower. We suggest you split your potential members into 2 or more smaller groups if you have more people.</p>

  <p>Can I have non-university students in my team?</p>
  <p>Yes. You can have a team entirely comprised of non-students. While this is a competition aimed at junior programmers studying at Victoria University we encourage anyone who wants to compete and share their knowledge to join up.</p>

  <p>Do you supply food or water?</p>
  <p>For those who have indicated they wish to pay extra for food we will be supplying something during the compitition (still being decided). Water is freely available at drinking fountains and in bathrooms.</p>

  <p>What do I need to bring?</p>
  <p>The only things you are "required" to bring are your entry fee and a computer. Everything else, including food, spare clothes and deodorant, is optional but highly recommended. Please bring headphones if you need sound, there will be a lot of other people who do not want or need to listen to your bad music or repetitive gameplay testing (Looking at you TAFT).</p>

  <p>Do you have a spare computer for me to use?</p>
  <p>No. See "What do I need to bring?".</p>

  <p>Will there be internet?</p>
  <p>Yes. There is guaranteed internet over VUW's guest WiFi. We will also setup faster wired internet and WiFi, provided we don't run into technical troubles (again). You will need internet to make your final submission.</p>

  <p>Is there (overnight) parking available?</p>
  <p>Yes. There is free parking available all weekend, see <a href="#where">below</a> for where to park. Officially it is available from 7pm Friday until 5am Monday, but if you're lucky you could park there earlier on Friday night. We take no responsibility if you get ticketed/clamped before 7pm on the Friday though.</p>

  <p>Can I go homeâ€¦ please?</p>
  <p>Yes. You can leave and come back anytime, as many times as you want. In the spirit of game jams, we encourage everyone to spend their time programming at the event. We also want people to look after themselves, which can include sleeping in their own bed instead of on the floor. After hours you will need a current student ID card to access the building, but you will be able to contact one of the event organizers if you get locked out at any point.</p>

  <p>Can you take care of my stuff?</p>
  <p>No. We are not responsible for property damaged or stolen at the event. That said, there are security cameras everywhere and we will provide assistance locating missing items if needed.</p>

  <p>Can I sleep on site?</p>
  <p>Yes, but please do it within the rooms we have booked for the event. In general, security do not like people sleeping on campus, current students or not. </p>

  <p>Is this PxlJm?</p>
  <p>No. This is not <a href="http://pxljm.com/">PxlJm</a>.</p>

  <p>PxlJm has t-shirts. Do you have t-shirts?</p>
  <p>No. This is the first year BluJm is running so we are trying to keep the costs low to make entry more accessible. T-shirts may become a option later on if we are successful.</p>

  <p>What are the prizes?</p>
  <p>The prizes are not decided before the competition but will be assembled during and revealed at the end. This is due to not having any money prior to the competition. First place, however, will be granted free entry into <a href="http://pxljm.com/">PxlJm</a> along with the top prize.</p>

  <p>Do bigger teams mean less prizes?</p>
  <p>Not necessarily. We haven't finalized how prizes will be given out, but will strive ensure that a larger team will not mean that each person will be awarded with less.</p>

  <p>How does voting/judging work?</p>
  <p>Good question.</p>

  <p>Why the name BluJm?</p>
  <p>It started when we were looking to create another game jam alongside PxlJm. We focused on encouraging and nurturing newer people while still having the more experienced game makers join in. We decided that by restricting the allowed tools to those that newer people are familiar with they would feel more comfortable creating a game with them. The name BluJm comes from the <a href="http://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a> IDE that new ECS students use at VUW use when they learn to program in Java.</p>
