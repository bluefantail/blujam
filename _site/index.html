      <h1>The specificest game jam in Wellington</h1>
      <p class="feature">
        BluJm is a 48-hour game making competition with some very unique rules.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You must use pure Java and the ECS100 library to make your game
        </li>
        <li>
          No external libraries are allowed
        </li>
        <li>
          Your game must be presented primarily through the <code>UI</code> class in the ECS100 library
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        BluJm starts at 6pm on the Friday with the announcement of the theme, and runs until 6pm Sunday followed by voting and prize giving. Everyone from first-year university students to seasoned game makers are welcome to sign up and make some games.
      </p>
	  <p>
	    Your game is only allowed to use the Java standard library, the <a href="https://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/foswiki/pub/Courses/COMP102_2016T1/JavaResources/ecs100.jar">ECS100 library</a>, any code that we provide, and any pure Java that you write yourselves at or before BluJm. This means no LWJGL, JOGL, JNI, third-party game or physics engines etc. While you must use the window provided by the ECS100 <code>UI</code> class, you are allowed to modify the <code>JFrame</code>, although we discourage just removing all of its components.
	  </p>
      <p>
        There are no restrictions on the amount of preparation your team can make before the event, but we discourage you from building for a specific game. The theme is only announced at the start of the competition, and we want you to turn up with an open mind for potential games.
      </p>

      <h1>FAQ</h1>

      <div id="questions" class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
  <p>What are these ECS100 and UI thing you keep talking about?</p>
  <p>The ECS100 library is the only library (aside from the Java standard library) permitted by BluJm rules. It is the library given to 100-level Engineering and Computer Science students at Victoria University of Wellington when they start learning Java and forms the backbone of this competition.</p>

  <p>Why can't I use X language instead of Java</p>
  <p>We want this event to focus on junior developers while giving a fun twist. Look out for PxlJm.</p>

  <p>Why can't I use X library/jar/engine?</p>
  <p>We have a hard rule on submissions not using any external libraries. We discourage the use of code not written by your team members as it detracts from the original meaning of the game jam. You can however copy/combine/change your existing code to fit your project, meaning you could create an engine for your team before the competition (in fact, we encourage this). Look out for PxlJm.</p>

  <p>I didn't sign up, can I still come?</p>
  <p>[TODO]</p>

  <p>How many people can I have in my team?</p>
  <p>We impose a maximum of 5 for your own good; larger teams are harder to coordinate. This also keeps the teams on a roughly level playing field in terms of manpower. We suggest you split your potential members into 2 or more smaller groups if you have more people.</p>

  <p>Do you supply food or water?</p>
  <p>Water is freely available at drinking fountains and in bathrooms. We might do pizza.</p>

  <p>What do I need to bring?</p>
  <p>The only things you are "required" to bring are your entry fee and a computer. Everything else, including food, spare clothes and deodorant, is optional but highly recommended. Please bring headphones if you need sound, there will be a lot of other people who do not want or need to listen to your bad music or repetitive gameplay testing (Looking at you TAFT).</p>
</div>

<div class="six columns">
  <p>Do you have a spare computer for me to use?</p>
  <p>No. See "What do I need to bring?".</p>

  <p>Will there be internet?</p>
  <p>Yes. There is guaranteed internet over VUW's guest WiFi. We will also setup faster wired internet and WiFi, provided we don't run into technical troubles (again). You will need internet to make your final submission.</p>

  <p>Is there (overnight) parking available?</p>
  <p>Yes. There is free parking available all weekend, see <a href="#where">below</a> for where to park. Officially it is available from 7pm Friday until 5am Monday, but if you're lucky you could park there earlier on Friday night. We take no responsibility if you get ticketed before 7pm on the Friday though.</p>

  <p>Can I go homeâ€¦ please?</p>
  <p>Yes. You can leave and come back anytime, as many times as you want. In the spirit of game jams, we encourage everyone to spend their time programming at the event. We also want people to look after themselves, which can include sleeping in their own bed instead of on the floor. After hours you will need a current student ID card to access the building, but you will be able to contact one of the event organizers if you get locked out at any point.</p>

  <p>Why the name BluJm?</p>
  <p>It started when we were looking to create another game jam alongside PxlJm. We focused on encouraging and nurturing newer people while still having the more experienced game makers join in. We decided that by restricting the allowed tools to those that newer people are familiar with they would feel more comfortable creating a game with them. The name BluJm comes from the <a href="http://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a> IDE that new ECS students use at VUW use when they learn to program in Java.</p>
