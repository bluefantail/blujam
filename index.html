      <h1>The specificest game jam in Wellington.</h1>
      <p class="feature">
        BluJm is a 48-hour game making competition with some very uniques rules.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You must use Java and the ECS100 Library to make your game
        </li>
        <li>
          No external Libraries/Jars/Engines allowed (apart from ecs100.jar)
        </li>
        <li>
          Your game must be presented primarily through the Window provided by the UI class in the ECS100 Library
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        BluJm starts at 6pm on a Friday with the announcement of the theme, and runs until 6pm Sunday followed by voting and prize giving. Everyone from First-year university students, to seasoned game makers are welcome to sign up and make some games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be aware... there are no restrictions on the amount of preparation of your team's code before the event, be we discourage you building for a specific game before the theme is announced at the start of the competition. And while you must use the window provided by the UI class in the ECS100 Library, there are no restrictions on the modifications you can make to the JFrame itself, though we discourage just removing all of it's components.
